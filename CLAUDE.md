# LaundryMart — Project State & Change Management

## 0. Update protocol
This is the canonical shipped state. MEMORY.md holds the live session delta (auto-loaded).
After any change to `src/` or `supabase/`, in the SAME commit: update the affected section
below and add a Changelog entry (newest on top). The Stop hook warns on drift.

## 1. Overview
Commercial Laundry Management System — customers, service agreements, depot-aware routing,
an offline driver run, inventory and billing. Next.js 15 (App Router) + Supabase
(Postgres/RLS/Auth) + Vercel, AU (Sydney).

The master spec names a .NET 9 Web API; this build follows the supplied skeleton instead
(Next.js + Supabase, Server Actions in place of REST). The domain model is unchanged.

## 2. Architecture
- RLS-bound client `createClient()` (safe) vs service-role `createAdminClient()` (bypasses
  RLS — always filter `tenant_id`).
- Auth via `getClaims()` (local JWT verify, no network); `requireSession()` is memoised per
  request. `requireCapability()` guards pages; `assertCapability()` guards actions.
- Functions pinned to `syd1` to co-locate with the Sydney DB (vercel.json).
- Server Actions only for writes. They derive `tenant_id` from the session and redirect with
  `?error=` / `?ok=`. The one exception is `/api/sync`, which exists because the offline
  outbox needs a batch endpoint it can replay.
- Pure domain logic lives in `src/lib/domain/` with no database access: the service calendar,
  pricing, ABN validation and date helpers. Unit-tested; shared by preview, route generation
  and invoicing so they cannot diverge.
- Invoice PDFs render server-side with `@react-pdf/renderer` (`src/lib/pdf/`), streamed from
  `/api/invoices/:id/pdf` and attached to the Resend email. `serverExternalPackages` keeps the
  renderer out of the client bundle.

## 3. Multi-tenancy and authorisation
Tenant key `tenant_id` → `tenants`. RLS helper `is_member(tenant_id)`, wrapped `(select …)`
so it evaluates once per query. `apply_tenant_policy(table)` attaches RLS + index + trigger,
so a new table cannot ship without a policy.

Resource-scoped beyond tenancy:
- `daily_routes` / `jobs`: when the caller's role is `driver`, rows are filtered to their own
  `drivers.id` via `current_driver_id()`.
- `pickups` / `deliveries` / `*_lines` / `vehicle_inspections`: scoped through the parent's
  own RLS, so a driver never reaches another driver's paperwork.
- `invoices` and friends: readable by any member, writable only by
  super_admin / operations_manager / finance / dispatcher.
- `storage.objects` in the `run-media` bucket: the object key starts with the tenant id, and
  the policies read it back through `media_tenant()` → `is_member()`. The path is the boundary,
  so it is always written from the session and never from the request.

Roles and capabilities are declared once in `src/lib/roles.ts` and drive the nav, page guards
and action guards.

## 4. Business rules enforced in the database
- Run cannot start without `inspection_id` and `load_confirmed_at`; cannot close before
  `unloaded_at` (`guard_route_transition`).
- Items on an active agreement cannot be soft-deleted (`guard_item_soft_delete`).
- Customer / agreement / job / invoice / credit-note numbers come from `next_number()`.
- `move_inventory()` is the single entry point for stock changes: it upserts both pools and
  writes the ledger row in one transaction.
- `recalculate_invoice()` keeps invoice totals consistent with lines and payments.
- A production batch cannot start with an empty manifest, cannot be completed except from
  `ready_for_dispatch`, and cannot be reopened once finished (`guard_batch_transition`). Its
  manifest freezes when it leaves receiving — only `rejected_quantity` and notes stay writable
  (`guard_batch_line_change`), because everything else drove a stock movement.

## 5. Branch & deploy
Feature branch → PR → main. Vercel build runs the verify gate; CI runs verify, gitleaks and
the DB job (migrations + pgTAP + seed). Never force-push main.

## 6. Routes
`/` landing · `/login` · `/offline` · `/api/sync` · `/api/media` · `/api/invoices/:id/pdf`
`(app)`: `/dashboard` · `/customers[/new|/:id|/:id/edit]` · `/agreements[/new|/:id]` ·
`/items[/:id]` · `/drivers` · `/vehicles` · `/routes/templates[/:id]` ·
`/routes/daily[/:id|/:id/sheet]` · `/jobs[/:id]` ·
`/operations/{pickups,deliveries,exceptions}` · `/run` · `/warehouse[/:id]` · `/inventory` ·
`/invoices[/:id]` · `/reports` · `/admin[/depots|/users|/holidays|/audit]`

## 7. Schema
- `0001_init` — tenants, memberships, RLS helpers, `apply_tenant_policy`, number sequences,
  audit logs.
- `0002_operations_core` — depots, customers, locations, contacts, items, vehicles, fuel
  logs, drivers.
- `0003_service_agreements` — public holidays, agreements (jsonb patterns, holiday rules,
  versioning), priced lines, item-delete guard.
- `0004_routing_execution` — route templates and stops, daily routes, vehicle inspections,
  jobs, pickups/deliveries and their lines, additional charges, run-transition guard,
  driver-scoped RLS.
- `0005_inventory` — pools, movement ledger, `move_inventory()`, stock counts, containers.
- `0006_billing` — invoices, lines, payments, credit notes, `recalculate_invoice()`,
  role-gated write policies.
- `0007_media` — the private `run-media` bucket, `media_tenant()`, and tenant-scoped policies
  on `storage.objects`.
- `0008_invoice_delivery` — `invoices.emailed_to`, stamped at send time.
- `0009_warehouse` — production batches and their manifest lines, stage/manifest guards.

Proofs in `supabase/tests/`: `rls_isolation`, `rls_coverage`, `driver_scope`,
`business_rules`, `media_scope`, `warehouse_rules` (45 assertions). Demo data in
`supabase/seed.sql` — not applied by migrations.

`scripts/health/pg-bootstrap.sql` shims what Supabase provides outside our migrations: the
`auth` schema, and the `storage` bucket/object tables plus `foldername()` that 0007 attaches
policies to.

## 8. Offline
`src/lib/offline/queue.ts` (IndexedDB outbox, client-generated refs) +
`src/components/offline-capture.tsx` (capture UI, flush on save / `online` / SW message) +
`public/sw.js` (shell cache, never intercepts writes) + `/api/sync` (idempotent batch insert
keyed on `client_ref`, unique per tenant).

Photos and signatures ride in the same record as data URLs and upload one file at a time to
`/api/media` *before* the batch goes out, so a queue of stops is never one multi-megabyte
request that fails as a unit. Object keys are deterministic (`clientRef` + index) and the
upload upserts, so a replay overwrites rather than duplicates. A record whose media fails to
upload stays queued whole — half a proof-of-service on the server is worse than none.

## 9. Media
`src/lib/media.ts` (shared constants + path builder, no I/O) · `/api/media` (one file per
request, tenant segment written from the session) · `src/lib/media-urls.ts` (`signMedia()`,
short-lived signed URLs, server-only) · `src/components/media-capture.tsx` (camera + canvas
signature, downscales on device) · `media-upload-field.tsx` (the online forms) ·
`proof-of-service.tsx` (display). Nothing is public: reads always go through a signed URL.

## 10. Environment
See `.env.example`; validated fail-fast in `src/lib/env.ts`. Email delivery
(`RESEND_API_KEY`, `INVOICE_FROM_EMAIL`) is optional — without it the app runs and the send
action says so rather than the deployment refusing to boot.

## 18. Changelog
### 2026-08-05 · Proof of service, invoice delivery, warehouse, per-kg billing
- **Per-kg invoicing.** `per_kg` agreement lines billed nothing at all — the generator
  returned quantity 0 while the agreement UI happily offered the model, so a configured
  customer was silently under-billed every period. Weight now comes from the period's actual
  pickups (`allocateWeightCharges`), with the included allowance applied per collection.
  Agreement-level `percentage` lines had the same hole and now charge against the same base as
  the levies, so nothing compounds.
- **Photos and signatures.** New private `run-media` bucket keyed by tenant, `/api/media`
  upload endpoint, on-device downscaling, canvas signature capture, and signed-URL display on
  the job page. Works offline through the existing outbox. `Permissions-Policy` relaxed from
  `camera=()` to `camera=(self)` — it would otherwise have blocked the feature.
- **Invoice PDF + email.** Server-rendered tax invoice (`/api/invoices/:id/pdf`) and a Resend
  send action that attaches it. Drafts and voids refuse to send; the address is stamped on the
  invoice; failures are audited, not just surfaced.
- **Warehouse (§7.16).** Production batches through washing → drying → folding → packing →
  ready for dispatch, each stage a real `move_inventory()` call, with mid-process rejects to
  repair or damaged. Manifest freezes when the batch leaves receiving.
- Added `vitest.config.ts` (the `@/` alias, and `jsx: automatic` — without it a `.tsx` module
  under test renders nothing at all).

### 2026-08-05 · Initial build
Full MVP against the master spec: multi-tenant spine with RLS + pgTAP proofs, depots,
customers, service agreements with pattern/holiday engine, items, fleet, route templates and
daily routes, jobs with pickups and deliveries, offline driver run, inventory ledger,
invoicing with generation from agreements, seven reports, and administration.

### (init) · Skeleton scaffolded — multi-tenant spine, RLS proof, CI, .claude baseline.
